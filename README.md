# Project_Ice
Project Ice is a project being undertaken by two UPenn freshman CIS students
which aims to get rid of the issue of being late to work/class because your
car window has unexpectedly frozen over. We are creating an app which will analyze
the weather conditions of your location the previous night and give you a notification
if it is likely that your car window is frozen over.
